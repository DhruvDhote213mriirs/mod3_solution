      <p class="item-name" id="Shahi_Paneer">Shahi Paneer</p>
      <p > Shahi paneer is a preparation of paneer, native to the Indian subcontinent, consisting of a thick gravy of cream, tomatoes and Indian spices.

        Originating with the creamy delicacies of Mughlai cuisine (hence the term "shahi", in reference to the royal title of Shahanshah in Mughal India), this dish is prepared by emulsifying tomatoes, onions, ground cashews, clarified butter and cream into a curry, with the addition of paneer cubes and a variety of spices.
        
        It is mainly eaten with traditional Indian flat-breads like roti or naan, rice and bread. Paneer is derived from the Persian word for cheese, and shahi is the term for royal (in reference to the Imperial Court of the Mughal Empire).
        
        Similar dishes include paneer butter masala and kadai paneer. The subtle difference between paneer butter masala and shahi paneer is that more of whole spices are used in paneer butter masala, whereas shahi paneer has a sweeter taste when compared to paneer butter masala.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name" id="Dosa">Dosa</p>
      <p >A dosa or dose is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent in recent times. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with chutney and in recent times sambar. Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder).<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
